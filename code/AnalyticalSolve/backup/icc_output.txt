NAME
       legalize_placement
              Executes detailed placement on a design.

SYNTAX
       status legalize_placement
              [-effort low | medium | high]
              [-check_only]
              [-eco]
              [-incremental]
              [-cells cell_objects]
              [-priority low | medium | high]
              [-timing]
              [-coordinates {llx1 lly1 urx1 ury1 ...}]

ARGUMENTS
       -effort low | medium | high
              Specifies  the  effort level for detailed placement. The default
              effort level is medium.

       -check_only
              Checks whether the design and the libraries have all the  neces-
              sary information to run the command.

       -eco   Derives locations for unplaced cells in the netlist. These cells
              are legally placed.

       -incremental
              This option specifies incremental legalization. This  option  is
              mainly  used  at the situation that most cells have already been
              legalized. This option will try to move as fewer cells as possi-
              ble  (but  may  be larger distance). A suitable situation to use
              this option is in  post-route  optimization.   This  option  can
              also  minimize  the  timing  critical cell displacement if it is
              used combined with -timing option.

       -cells cell_objects
              This option will legalize a group of cells which have been spec-
              ified  by this option. This option will need to be used combined
              with the option  -priority.   If  -priority  low  is  specified,
              legalizer  will legalize the cells without moving other existing
              cells.  If -priority high is specified, the legalizer  will  try
              to  move  the cells in minimum distance by moving other existing
              cell away.  If -priority med is specified,  the  legalizer  will
              move both these cells and their surrounding cells.

       -priority low | medium | high
              This  option  is  only  used  with -cells option together.  This
              option specify the priority of a group of cells when this  group

                              legalize_placement

              of  cells are being legalized.  The default value is "low", i.e.
              legalizer will legalize the group of cells without  moving other
              surrounding  cells.   If -priority "med" is specified, legalizer
              will move this group of cells and their surrounding  cells  when
              they  are being legalized. At this time,  the cell movement will
              depend on their cell weights (cells are weighted  by  the  worst
              pin  slack as well as cell size).  If -priority "high" is speci-
              fied, legalizer will first snap these cells into  their  nearest
              legal  locations,  then  move other cells at those locations  to
              other legal locations.

       -timing
              This option is only used with  -cells  or  -incremental  option.
              This  option will control the incremental legalization move less
              distance for the cells on critical paths,  i.e.  the  cells  are
              weighted by the worst pin slack as well as cell size. The incre-
              mental legalization will weight a cell only based on  cell  size
              if -timing is not specified.

       -coordinates {llx1 lly1 urx1 ury1 ...}
              Only  used  with  -cells  option. Specify the rectilinear region
              (multiple rectangles) so that  the  command  only  legalize  the
              cells  within  the  region.  No  cell  will be moved outside the
              region, works like a fence to prevent  cells  move  out  of  the
              region.  The  coordinate is the float_list of {x1 y1 x2 y2 ...},
              unit of um.

DESCRIPTION
       The legalize_placement command performs placement legalization  on  the
       current  design,  where coarse placement has already been performed. If
       no -eco specified, it is necessary  to  supply  initial  locations  for
       every  cell  and blockage in the design before legalize. In addition, a
       physical library needs to be set using the  physical_library  variable.
       It is also necessary to specify a site array for the floorplan.

       Also note that the option -timing can only be used together with -cells
       or -incremental option.

       Note: After executinglegalize_placement, all the timings are  based  on
       steiner  routes of the design and any previous annotations are ignored.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       This command uses information from all active scenarios.
