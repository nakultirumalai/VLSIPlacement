STEPS involved in doing clustering given a list of 'n' cells:

STEP                                                   COMPLEXITY
Step 1: Create a new cell object. Mark it as           O(1)
        a cluster. Flag it as a clustered cell
	so that it wouldn't be included in the 
	iterations. Also generate the cluster name

Step 2: Add the created cell to the design database    O(1)

Step 3: Iterate over the list of all cells to be       O(n)   
        clustered and create a unique list of cells
        to be constructed. Capture the total 
        height and total width of the cells. 
        Add each cell as the child cell of the 
	cluster

Step 4: Get the resulting height and width of the      O(?)
        cluster cell to be formed 

Step 5: Perform clustering in the hypergraph           O(n) + O(np log k)

     	STEPS to perform clustering in the hypergraph:                COMPLEXITY
	Step 1: Iterate over all the cells in                  	      O(n)
	        the cell list and get the 
		corresponding indices of each cell 
		in the hypergraph

		(HyperGraph::clusterNodes)
 	Step 2: Iterate over all the node indices                     O(n)
	     	and check if any of the indices are not 
		top level indices
		
	Step 3: Complex step broken down into simple ones             O(np log k)
	     	Iterate over all the node indices and                 O(n)
	        for each node iterate over all the edge indices.      O(p)
		Perform hash lookup of visited edge index.            O(log k)   
		Create a new entry in the list of new edges. 	      O(log k)
		Remove the old node index from the edge indices       O(log k)
		for the node.
		
	Step 4: Add the new edge list as the edge list for the        O(log n)
	     	clustered node.
		
Step 6: Hide the nets that connect to only cells       O(?)
        within the cluster 

Step 7: Push the cluster cell into the return vector   O(1)

Step 8: Return the return vector
